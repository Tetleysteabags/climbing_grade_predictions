- `pkl_files/`: Stores serialized model files.
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies.

## Project info

Can a machine learning model accurately predict sport climbing and bouldering grades based on a userâ€™s strength metrics
- This project aims to determine the variables that most significantly influence climbing performance, and then trains a regression, random forest, and gradient boosting model using these variables
- MLflow is used to keep track of model performance.
- To learn about production, a simple front end is hosted on Streamlit where users can interact with the best performing model
- Users can input their strength metrics, and receive their predicted sport climbing and bouldering grades.
- In order to improve the models over time, users are requested to input their actual max sport climbing and bouldering grades.
- These values are then sent to MongoDB and retrieved to be used in re-training the models.
